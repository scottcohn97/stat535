# Statistics 535 Final Project

## Title: Evolution of wealth inequality in simulated networks.

*Team*: Scott Cohn, Vignesh Mahalingam, Liwen Ouyang

*Abstract*:  We use a network-based simulation to identify the emergent social structures of segregation based on distribution of cooperative behavior and income when individuals have a preference
for fairness and interact with agents when playing a Prisoner’s Dilemma game. We find that regardless of the initial wealth distribution (as measured by the Gini coefficient), the winning frequency by
play strategy is robust across changes in distribution of cooperative strategies
